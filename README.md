# README

This repository contains the frontend part of the bachelor's project, which serves as the user interface for the application. The frontend is developed using the Ruby on Rails framework and is designed to integrate with the backend API ([BP-API](https://github.com/LiquiNaut/BP-Api)) for data retrieval and manipulation. Additionally, the project utilizes the `sprockets-rails`, `devise`, and `select2-rails` gems.
